            <h2>What I have built</h2>
            <p>Over the years, I've built solid professional experience by working in different roles within the
                customer service and support industry. From handling high volumes of inbound and outbound calls
                to coaching teammates and improving internal processes, each role has helped me grow not only in
                technical skills but also in communication, organization, and problem-solving. Working remotely
                with U.S. based companies has strengthened my ability to adapt, stay focused, and deliver results
                in fast-paced environments.

                Now, I'm working on expanding that experience by adding programming projects to my
                skill set. I'm currently learning to code, and my goal is to build real, practical solutions that
                reflect both my technical growth and my background in client focused work.</p>

            <h2>Teleperformance</h2>
            <h3>Technical Support Agent</h3>
            <h4>Dec. 2016 - Sept. 2019</h4>
            <p> I worked as a semi-bilingual technical support agent for a private mobility service app, assisting both
                drivers and passengers primarily via email. My main tasks included resolving technical issues, answering
                service-related questions, and escalating complex cases when needed.

                Although most interactions were in Spanish, I occasionally handled inquiries in English and supported
                customers through voice calls as well, which helped me build confidence and fluency in both written and
                spoken communication.

                This role strengthened my customer service skills, improved my attention to detail, and taught me how to
                troubleshoot efficiently in a fast-paced environment.</p>

            <h3>Customer Service Representative</h3>
            <h4>Apr 2022 - Oct. 2022</h4>
            <p>I worked as a customer service representative for BJ's Wholesale Club, supporting U.S.-based customers
                through live chat and phone calls. My role focused on assisting members with a wide range of inquiries,
                including orders, returns, warranties, credit issues, and escalations to other departments.

                This experience allowed me to significantly improve my English fluency by communicating daily with
                native speakers in real time. I also strengthened my ability to handle complex service cases, multitask
                under pressure, and maintain a friendly, solutions-oriented approach.</p>

                <h2>Concentrix</h2>
                <h3>Client Relations Specialist</h3>
                <h4>Jan. 2023 - Feb. 2024</h4>
                <p>I started at Concentrix as a voice agent supporting the Allstate Insurance campaign, assisting
                    U.S.-based customers with tasks such as processing payments, reviewing documents, updating vehicle
                    information, and modifying insurance policies based on customer needs. I also managed escalations
                    and consistently delivered service with empathy and professionalism.

                    I was promoted to Senior Subject Matter Expert (Sr. SME) not only because of my strong performance
                    metrics, but also because of the way I treated everyone—clients, teammates, and leadership—with
                    respect, patience, and a genuine desire to help. I also had deep knowledge of the product, which
                    allowed me to support others more effectively.

                    As an SME, I worked closely with new hire waves, guiding them through training and nesting,
                    conducting call audits, and delivering refresher sessions and personalized coaching. It was the role
                    I enjoyed the most, as it allowed me to connect with people, support their growth, and create a
                    positive environment for both customers and colleagues.</p>

                <p>I provided technical support for Namely, a U.S.-based HR platform offering services like onboarding,
                    payroll, benefits administration, talent management, and more. My clients were HR teams from various
                    companies, and I assisted them through phone, email, and video calls.

                    My responsibilities included answering general questions, guiding users through platform
                    functionalities, and escalating tickets to specialized departments when needed. This role
                    strengthened my skills in SaaS support, client communication, and issue resolution across multiple
                    channels.</p>

                <h2>WorldWideBDC</h2>
                <h3>Appointment Setter and Customer Service Specialist</h3>
                <h4>Jan 2025 - Jul 2025</h4>
                <p>At Worldwide BDC, I worked as an Appointment Setter supporting automotive dealerships across the U.S.
                    The company specializes in delivering inbound and outbound services tailored to the automotive
                    industry.

                    I started by handling inbound calls, where I scheduled service appointments, answered general
                    inquiries, transferred calls, left messages, and escalated issues when needed. Thanks to my empathy
                    and clear communication, I was later moved to the outbound team, focusing on proactively contacting
                    customers to confirm or set appointments.

                    In this role, I also worked with over 20 different CRM systems simultaneously, which helped me
                    sharpen my multitasking skills and adapt quickly to different tools, workflows, and dealership
                    requirements.</p>
